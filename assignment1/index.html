                    Upon entering the Amorphous website, it is blatantly obvious that this is a drawing website where 
                    users can use the various buttons to construct a monochromatic drawing. On the top right there are 
                    multiple 'tones' of brushes the users can choose from, ranging from plain white, to black and white 
                    spots, to plain black. This allows the users to produce shading to mimic the various light and shadows. 
                    Next to the tones, on the top, are the pen tool, eraser tool and bucket tool, each one clearly marked 
                    by an icon which makes the function unmistakable. and next to it, three more buttons that adjust the 
                    shape of the brush between a rectangle, square and circle. The buttons on and slider on the left allows
                    the users to adjust the size of the brush, and there are undo, redo, move, and 'fit to screen' buttons 
                    as well. On the top left, the File and Image buttons, which drop down to show more options.

                    <br>

                    I began interacting with it rather quickly and experimented a little bit with the brushes, both in terms
                    of size, shape, and tones made available to me. As I was drawing with my mouse, and much more accustomed
                    to drawing digitally on a tablet with a stylus pen, it was a bit difficult, however, it was for that reason
                    that the undo button was such a godsend when trying to fix mistakes. I found myself adjusting the size of the 
                    brush often, and to my own surprise, I did not take full advantage of the available monochromatic tones to
                    shade my drawing. Personally, I believe the reason for that was because I was unfamiliar with how to shade using
                    textured tones, thus making them a bit intimidating, but over time I would warm up to it. Finally, I used the 
                    Save File function found under 'File' to save my drawing, as seen on the left.

                        <li style="padding-left:15px;"> <b>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b>
                        </li>


                        <p>When first interacting with Amorphous, I immediately started sliding the brush size slider to check the range of sizes
                        the experience offered, trying to gauge how far I could go with my creativity.</p>

                        <li> <b>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</b>
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        The variety of brush tones was fun to play around with, as I spent a while swatching each one in the largest 
                        possible brush size to get a closer look at the textures. Besides that, I spent the most time drawing the actual
                        illustration with the brush tool and fixing any mistakes with the undo button.

                        <li> <b> What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b>
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        My most common action during the interaction was most definitely using the undo button to remove my mistakes. I also 
                        used the brush size slider often, but not as much as I did the undo button. I personally found it more reliable than
                        the eraser tool.

                        </li>

                        <br>

                        The primary goal of the experience was not difficult at all to decipher as it was rather 
                        straightforward. It was quickly obvious that the goal is having the users attempt a new
                        digital drawing experince.

                        </li>
    
                        <br>

                        The use of very icons and text within the website's buttons to help the users 
                        identify specific functions is clear and clean. They are simple, and very common, 
                        but that means that users will automatically know their functions through association.

                    <section>
    
                        <li> <b> What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to 
                            interact with the experience?</b>

                         <br>
                    
                         I personally felt like the website itself was nothing special as an experience. Certainly it was unique due to the 
                         brushes having certain textures. It was simply a monochromatic, simplified version of Microsoft Paint with a few fun 
                         brushes. There are better alternatives to digital painting. This experience felt like something fun for a while, but 
                         not something for the long term, albeit I can see why users would come back again for the unique experience.

                    <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
                        <section style="margin-right:20px;border-radius:8%;">

                            <li> <b>What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</b>
                            </li>

                            <br>

                            I believe Amorphous acts as a metaphor for a literal blank canvas, as well as a blackboard. The contrast between 
                            light and dark is also very harsh, the monochromatic nature of it reminding me of old black and white photography 
                            as well. The website could also serve as a metaphor for duality, binaries, and freedom of expression.

                </div>
                  
                <br>

                <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
                    <section style="max-width:40%;">

                        <li style="padding-left:15px;"> <b>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</b>
                        </li>

                        <br>

                        The metaphor of the blank canvas/blackboard incites the users to fill up the empty space with 
                        their own creative ideas. It picks on the human desire to build and create. The metaphor of duality
                        and binaries, fuelled by the sharp contrast of black and white as the only available shades also 
                        allows the users to feel a sense of starkness, as it makes every single stroke show quite prominently
                        against the black background. There is a feeling of finality, and one can't help but feel that their
                        artwork has a great impact.

                        <br>
                        
                        I believe the most frustrating element of the website is how it depends on the limited number of tones
                        available to the user. It takes quite a lot of experimenting and swatching to figure out how one might be
                        able to use them in shading and texturing their works, and personally, I think it takes far too much effort
                        to create a semi-decent drawing. In addition, since most people use computer mouses instead of drawing tablets
                        and pens, it was also quite frustrating to draw with it. There was a high chance of hand cramps.

                        <br>

                        It is a particularly satifying feeling when you need to fill in a large part of your drawing using the paintbucket tool.
