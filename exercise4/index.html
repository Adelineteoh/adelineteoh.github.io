        <!-- I placed the chapter button in between the rewind and fast forward buttons as it is a compromise between them. In the case where the users wish to look for
          a specific part of the video, this button allows them to jump to the key transition points in the video (from the introduction of materials, to the windmill
          section, and then finally the stalk of the windmill. These distinct separations will allow the users to jump between parts without having to wait minutes for
          the rewind and fast forward buttons for a long time.) */-->
