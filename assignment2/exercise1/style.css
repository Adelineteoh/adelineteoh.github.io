/*For my colour palette, I chose a very dark grey for the main background,
and a set of very vibrant and bright fluorescent colours for both contrast,
and to bring some interesting colours into the mix. I decided on this having
used shades of grey for my previous assignment and wanting to do something
similar with the dark grey, but give it a rave aesthetic. I checked the colours
in Greyscale just to make sure there was enough contrast between the colours
for colourblind users to differentiate the aqua and green as well. And by 
making the border white, the contrast is much more clear, even making them 
look like they are popping out of the dark background, whcih I think is an 
interesting design.*/

/*For the Hedra panels, I used Layoutit.com to initially mark out
how my grid was meant to look, and copy-pasted the template onto my
HTML and CSS. After that, I had to make some minor adjustments 
including the height of the boxes and adding the individual panel 
colours. I also had to go on HTML and apply the borders onto each 
panel's 'class'.*/
